We need 2 arrays to represent the simplex table 1 for columns and 1 for rows
to determin their size, well ask the user to give us the number of decision variables
and holguras.
the columns size will be the given number of variables including holguras +1 for solution,
and the rows, the holguras + 1, becouse of z row.
now well ask the user to fill the decision variables's values in the table, row by row
and also the solution column in the holguras
every given row, we'll fill the holguras columns
most of this thing will be done with for loop
after this, its all  the programs work.
we must now select our pivot.
we fetch the lesser number in the z row with a for loop, now make a pointer that points
to the pivot column.
next well need another for loop.
for the pivot row, we divide the holguras solution by the corespondient pivot column value
to get the ratio, if the pivot columns value is zero or negative, it should be ignored, 
well be comparing the previous smaller ratio with the current ratio, and if the ratio is smaller
well point to that position with a pointer. at the end we should have a pointer pointing to
the pivot row's array.
now the pivot is found in ptr to pivotRow + pivot column index.

now we start the first iteration
we need another table with the same size as before to save the changes
in the pivot row's index we insert pivotRow/pivot
now we replace the other rows:
row = row (-1 * (pivotColumnValue in row index) * (newPivotRowValue) ))
all this with a loop
and if theres negative numbers in z row, repeat
if not
print the simplex table
